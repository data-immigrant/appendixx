# Appendix D – Market & Financials (Summary)

## Market reach
- **EU food traceability**: multi‑billion EUR market; strong regulatory pull and consumer demand.  
- **Global traceability**: tens of billions USD by early 2030s.  
- **Audience breadth**: B2C consumers (app), B2B producers/retailers (dashboards/API), B2G regulators (compliance tooling).

## Revenue streams
1) B2C: paid micro‑courses; optional subscriptions.  
2) B2B: producer subscriptions & data passports.  
3) B2G/B2B: compliance licences, APIs.  
4) Services: quantum‑assisted logistics optimisation (later).

## Unit economics (drivers)
- L2 batched writes; IPFS off‑chain storage; CDN/edge caching → **declining cost/user** with scale.  
- Community moderation & staking → **sub‑linear ops costs** vs. user growth.
