# Appendix F – Tokenomics & Community Governance (Scalability)

- **Utility token** rewards constructive contributions (reports, validations, content).  
- **Staking** required for reporting/voting → discourages spam; aligns incentives.  
- **On‑chain moderation** with council actions logged; slashing for abuse; rewards vesting.  
- **Economic effect:** as user base grows, moderation capacity scales with it; paid staff needs grow slowly (sub‑linear).  
- **Interoperability:** ERC‑20 on zkEVM; walletconnect; optional KYC for regulated features.
